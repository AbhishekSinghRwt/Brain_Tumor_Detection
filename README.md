# Brain_Tumor_Detection

## Context

In this notebook, we investigate the task of detecting brain cancers from MRI scans using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Pre-trained Models. Brain tumors are a major health concern worldwide, and early diagnosis is critical to treatment and patient outcomes. With advances in deep learning and medical imaging technologies, CNNs have emerged as valuable tools for automating abnormality identification in medical pictures.

## Type of Machine Learning Problem :

This study's dataset consists of MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans of the brain obtained from patients with and without brain malignancies. This is binary Classification Problem . Each image in the collection is labeled 'yes' or 'no' to indicate the presence or absence of a tumor.
